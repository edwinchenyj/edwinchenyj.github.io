## Abstract
Physics-based simulation methods for deformable objects suffer limitations due to the conflicting requirements that are placed on them. The work horse semi-implicit (SI) backward Euler method is very stable and inexpensive, but it is also a blunt instrument. It applies heavy damping, which depends on the timestep, to all solution modes and not just to high-frequency ones. As such, it makes simulations less lively, potentially missing important animation details. At the other end of the scale, exponential methods (exponential Rosenbrock Euler (ERE)) are known to deliver good approximations to all modes, but they get prohibitively expensive and less stable for very stiff material. In this article, we devise a hybrid, semi-implicit method called SIERE that allows the previous methods SI and ERE to each perform what they are good at. To do this, we employ at each timestep a partial spectral decomposition, which picks the lower, leading modes, applying ERE in the corresponding subspace. The rest is handled (i.e., effectively damped out) by SI. No solution of nonlinear algebraic equations is required throughout the algorithm. We show that the resulting method produces simulations that are visually as good as those of the exponential method at a computational price that does not increase with stiffness, while displaying stability and damping with respect to the high-frequency modes. Furthermore, the phenomenon of occasional divergence of SI is avoided.
